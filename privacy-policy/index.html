Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.

          <h3>Widgets</h3>Widgets may support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information given the user's choice of participation.
